Robot Master,Trivia
Air Man,"If Mega Man is standing on Item-1 during the battle with Air Man in the NES version of Mega Man 2, he will not blow his tornadoes. Furthermore, if Mega Man is hit with an Air Shooter while standing on Item-1 next to the boss gate, a glitch will occur, transporting Mega Man to an unbeatable, glitchy stage one can only assume is Purgatory. It’s a perfect place for Mega Man to sit and think about what he’s done."
Alien,"In Mega Man 2, the Alien deals 6 damage with its shot and 20 damage on contact. Bubble Lead is the only weapon that damages it, while all other weapons simply refill its energy. Dr. Wily transforming into this green idiot and proceeding to fly around the room might be the single most joyous moment in video game history."
Aqua Man,"The North American Mega Man 8 manual states that Dr. Wily failed in his first attempt at creating an ice machine to use on Frost Man, but recycled his failed attempt by creating Aqua Man with a water tank instead of ice. This story was later retconned into him being a pre-existing robot modified by Wily."
Astro Man,
Auto,
Bad Boxart Mega Man,"As part of the rushed localization of the original Mega Man game, the president of Capcom U.S.A. told the marketing representative to have a cover done by the next day, so he had a friend draw it within about six hours. Thus, a masterpiece was created."
Ballade,
Bass,
Blade Man,
Blizzard Man,"He was the second ice-themed Robot Master since Ice Man from the first Mega Man game - a difference of five years. However, in every game following Mega Man 6 (with the exception of Mega Man 9), there has been an ice-themed Robot Master. You can say Blizzard Man was the harbinger of the Ice Age."
Bomb Man,"His Japanese name is literally translated as ""Bomberman."" Don’t let Konami find out; you know those fuckers will sue."
Break Man,"It is unknown why exactly Proto Man uses this lazy disguise it in his last battle in Mega Man 3, but it is believed to be just a disguise to hide his identity from Dr. Light. Proto Man is not nearly as cool as he think he is."
Bright Man,"He dislikes ""unmoral districts"" (a euphemism for where brothels and other ill repute areas are). These are often called ""Red-light districts,"" since brothels tend to have red lights in them. We all know Bright Man does not need to pay for such services."
Bubble Man,"When Bubble Man gets on land he hops like a frog. He looks ridiculous, and his robot brothers and even Dr. Wily make sure to point that out."
Burner Man,
Burst Man,How he is weak to the Scorch Wheel and Freeze Cracker in Mega Man 7 is a reference to how bubbles require suitable environments to maintain form; being either too hot or too cold without a good degree of moisture and humidity results in them quickly returning back to a liquid form. One might say that Burst Man is just a bit too sensitive.
Buster Rod G,
Centaur Man,"A centaur is a creature from Greek mythology with the upper body of a human and the lower body and legs of a horse. Centaur Man’s stage is possibly a reference to Atlantis, which in an allegory within Plato’s works Timaeus and Critias, represents an antagonist naval power that attacks Athens and is ultimately submerged by the deities."
Charge Man,"His design is modeled after old steam locomotives, and this is quite appropriate in 8BDM where fighting him is sort of like fighting an actual train."
Chill Man,
Cloud Man,"In Mega Man 7, if Danger Wrap is fired with exact timing as you enter his boss room, it will cause him to fall from above the screen and disappear. Then, two Thunder Bolts will fall from the sky, the screen will become distorted in appearance, and the player will die. It sucks."
Clown Man,"The North American Mega Man 8 manual states that Clown Man was originally a robot used on a science fiction TV show that Wily rescued after its cancellation. Made of old sets and props, Clown Man displays the charisma of show business. As Dr. Wily can't stop laughing at his long arms, Clown Man became especially proud of them due to never getting a laugh while on the show."
Cold Man,
Commando Man,
Concrete Man,"He was originally Cement Man. That was of course before they added water, stone, and sand to him."
Crash Man,"Is he really called “Clash Man?” Or maybe “Crush Man?” Either way, I usually call him the “C Meister.” Or “C-Pain.”"
Crystal Man,"His weakness against the Gyro Attack in Mega Man 5 is in reference to how mineral crystalline structures, even diamond which is one of the hardest minerals on Earth, can be cut down and polished into a desired shape due to their more overtly stiff and brittle molecular structure in contrast to the tensile and malleable composition of metal."
Cut Man,"In the original game, he takes 3 damage from Mega Man’s default weapon while the other original Robot Masters take only 1-2 damage. Clearly rock [buster] still beats scissors."
Dark Man 1,
Dark Man 2,
Dark Man 3,
Dark Man 4,
Dive Man,"Due to a design mistake, he can attack by launching himself forward like a torpedo, ramming into his foes to do major damage. I don’t know about this one. It kind of sounds like that design was on purpose."
Doc Robot,"His Japanese name, ""dokurobotto"", is actually the combination of two words: ""dokuro"", (""skull"") and ""robotto"" (""robot""). The name basically translates to ""skull robot"", which coincides with the motif of Dr. Wily building skull-based contraptions and robots."
Dr.Wily,
Drill Man,"In Mega Man 4, the only weapon able to deal damage on him while he's burrowing underground (albeit very little) is the Rain Flush. In 8BDM; however, the Rain Flush cannot damage Drill Man while he’s underground."
Duo,
Dust Man,"He is considered to have bad breath because the scents of the garbage he inhales remain in his ""mouth."" However, we have yet to rule out the possibility of tonsil stones."
Dynamo Man,
Elec Man,"His stage theme sounds very similar to ""Faithfully"" by Journey…"
Enker,
Evil Robot,"His appearance in the Archie comics marks the first time in any medium he has been given a name of his own. However, before he was officially given a name, fans referred to him as ""Oud"" due to his appearance being a mirror of Duo. “Oud” is also coincidentally an Arabic word for a certain lute-type instrument, which fits the music motif of Mega Man characters."
Fake Man,
Fire Man,"In Mega Man Powered Up, he speaks in a southern drawl. He must have left his cowboy hat cooking in the oven."
Flame Man,"He is believed to represent Saudi Arabia, due to his association with oil (Saudi Arabia is the largest oil exporter in the world). However, the fact that he wears a turban could indicate an association with Iran instead, since Iran is also a major exporter of oil and is at least somewhat associated with the turban (which is considered a tradition among Shia Muslims). In reality, Sikhs are the ones primarily associated with wearing turbans, but India of course has no association with oil whatsoever."
Flash Man,"His stage theme is sampled in M. Bison's theme, ""Irreconcilably,"" from the Street Fighter EX series, which is also published by Capcom. Also, I have to say, ""Irreconcilably"" is without a doubt the worst name given to anything. Flash Man probably deserves better. "
Freeze Man,"In Mega Man 7, when the player faces him again in Dr. Wily's Castle and hits him with his own weapon, the Freeze Cracker, the game will freeze and he'll look at the player as if to mock them. After a brief moment his health is restored and the game will resume. This makes Freeze Man the only Robot Master to break the fourth wall."
Frost Man,"In the Japanese version of Mega Man 8, he threats to turn Mega Man into a kakigōri (a type of shaved ice dessert flavored with syrup and condensed milk). In the English version of the game, he threatens to turn Mega Man into a popsicle (I’m not sure what it is)."
Galaxy Man,
Gemini Man,He is not to be mistaken with the boss from Rockman Strategy named “Gemini.” Just kidding; literally NOBODY would ever have that problem.
Gravity Man,"How he is weak to the Star Crash in Mega Man 5 may play into his workings of gravitational phenomena; while it is believed and proven that gravity is the result of spatial distortion, the other half which allows this to happen is that a great accumulation of mass must be present to allow itself a gravitational pull, and such masses evidenced are those of celestial objects like planets and suns. Even then, gravity itself is known to bear a limited influence in proportion to that mass's range and overall weight, to where planets themselves have their own influence outside of the sun's own, and is that of a spherical field like influence rather than a two dimensional attribute, due to the close perspective of surface dwelling beings. Notably, in Japanese language and nomenclature, the kanji for planets and stars are used to define both kinds of celestial objects, due to how in ancient times, planets were almost indistinguishable from the stars. For this reason, his weakness overcomes the limited influence of his gravity powers, as the Star Crash acts accurately akin to a solar system or a planet's orbit, while his powers only act in proportion to greater gravitational masses than act as a source of them, and inverts them akin to anti-gravity, leaving him vulnerable to dead angle collision of various things in orbit."
Grenade Man,"In Mega Man 8, his health bar does not play a sound as it fills up. This oddity is present in both the PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions of the game. Honestly, I don’t know what this guy’s problem is."
Ground Man,
Guts Man,His ass is a marvel to behold. Humans and robots from all walks of life travel from around the world for the opportunity to bask in its beauty.
Gyro Man,"In Mega Man 5, if the ceiling in his room is removed with a cheat device, he will fly above the screen and not return. Some say he’s still flying to this day."
Hard Man,"Officially, it is unknown what he was built for. All we know is that he is very lazy and complains quite often. Hard Man is a big fat mistake."
Heat Man,"His maximum temperature is said to reach 12,000 degrees Celsius. Being that this is higher than the Earth's core and the surface of the Sun, I find that it to be a bit excessive for a guy who looks like he’s designed to light fat blunts and oversized birthday candles."
Hornet Man,
Hyper Storm H,
Ice Man,"Mega Man Powered Up, he displays symptoms that are commonly associated with individuals possessing Dissociative Identity Disorder. This would make him the first and, thus far, only Robot Master to have a mental illness."
Jewel Man,"He was originally Diamond Man and a variety of colors for the jewels on his body were experimented with. In concept art, he is described using phrase “okama,” which is typically used as a slang term for gay men in Japan. Being that the “okama” is the honorific term for a cauldron, the origin of it as slang apparently stems from an analogy comparing a man's butt to the shape of certain pots (but surely there’s only one Robot Master to whom this can apply)."
Junk Man,"He shares his name with the main antagonist of The Incredible Crash Dummies, which predated the release of Mega Man 7 by a couple years. Could it be…?"
Jupiter,
King,
Knight Man,"He is believed to represent the United Kingdom, due to his being based upon the classic depiction of a chivalrous knight, and his stage being based upon a castle that bears a resemblance to English castles such as Warwick Castle and Alnwick Castle. However, as Knight Man's flail is German in origin and his armor is interchangeable, some suspect that Knight Man is actually intended to represent Germany instead (additionally, the trees at the beginning of his level could be a reference to Germany's famous Black Forest)."
Maestro,
Magic Man,
Magma Man,
Magnet Man,He does not like floppy disks because when a magnet is put on a floppy disk it corrupts the data on the disk. Imagine being unable to get close to loved ones without harming them. Now imagine suffering that fate with a dang horseshoe fastened to your forehead.
Mars,
Mega Man,“NOW I HAVE YOUR POWER!”
Mega Water S,
Mercury,
Metal Man,"He is one of Keiji Inafune's least favorite bosses in Mega Man 2 because he is ""too easy."" It is unclear whether this is in reference to the character’s difficulty as a boss or his promiscuity."
Napalm Man,"His interview quote in Mega Man: Battle & Chase is the only one out of all the robots to be stated in English instead of Japanese. He says, ""I'll be back,"" which might be a Terminator reference, but it’s also possible that Napalm Man just left to run an errand and said the line to assure the interviewer that he would return shortly, and the quote was simply taken out of context. Then again, that wouldn’t explain why he said it in English. Maybe Napalm Man doesn’t speak Japanese? I might be going out on a limb with this one."
Needle Man,"In the cell phone version of Mega Man 3, he hangs in the air as he fires his Needle Cannon, as opposed to the NES version where he slowly descends while firing. People who play Mega Man on their phone are being punished mercilessly."
Neptune,
Nitro Man,
Oil Man,"When talking to Fire Man, he says that fire is not allowed at his oil rig, even though Hotheads and Tackle Fires abound throughout his stage. What a douchebag. I'm honestly glad he got cancelled for wearing blackface."
Origin-Duo,
Pharaoh Man,"In an iconic scene from the cartoon, Mega Man ambushes him by jumping out of a fountain, touching him, and stealing his weapon, but then Pharaoh Man nonchalantly punches Mega Man and sends him flying. It’s really funny."
Pirate Man,
Plant Man,"He is believed to represent Brazil and the Amazon rainforest. However, because Plant Man's design is thought to be based on the Rafflesia flower, which grows in Southeast Asia rather than South America, some speculate he may be from Malaysia or Indonesia instead. It is worth noting that he is definitively from Brazil in the Archie comics."
Plug Man,"He was originally Plasma Man, and had the appearance of a plasma globe. I imagine this design was scrapped because members of the dev team kept getting distracted by his allure, which would beckon them to place their hands on his body and stare at his fluorescence for hours on end."
Pluto,
Proto Man,In Japan he’s known as “Blues” even though he’s clearly red. What a blunder.
Pump Man,
Punk,
Quick Man,"In Mega Man Megamix Volume 1, he is described to be faster than light by Elec Man after their short battle, which sounds like a huge exaggeration."
Quint,
Ra Thor,
Ring Man,He is the only character whose NetNavi counterpart is the opposite gender from the original. Ring.EXE appears exclusively in Mega Man Battle Chip Challenge.
Roll,
Search Man,"He is the only Robot Master to have two heads, and I can’t for the life tell you why Capcom wanted a two-headed Robot Master. Personally, I believe one head is plenty. That being said, I have nothing against anyone with two or more heads, and that includes Search Man; he’s a good man."
Shade Man,"The design of his stage in Mega Man 7 pays homage to another Capcom game, Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts for the SNES. In fact, if the player holds down the ""B"" button while selecting Shade Man’s stage, then music for the stage changes to the main theme from the Ghosts 'n Goblins game series."
Shadow Man,"He is rumored to have been created by an extraterrestrial civilization. His deactivated body was discovered by Dr. Wily, who then remodeled and reprogrammed him for combat. Do you think aliens watch anime too?"
Skull Man,"In Mega Man 4, his AI is not programmed to act until the player moves horizontally or shoots. Many consider Skull Man to be a grandmaster in staring contests."
Slash Man,"His stage in Mega Man 7 may have been inspired by an episode of the Mega Man cartoon called Robosaur Park, which takes place in a tropical park full of robotic dinosaur replicas. However, what more likely happened was that they were both independently inspired by Jurassic Park."
Snake Man,"He is credited to liking Toad Man and disliking slugs. This comes from a Japanese variation of Rock Paper Scissors where Snake beats Toad, Toad beats Slug, and Slug beats Snake."
Sniper Joe,
Spark Man,"Although he allegedly possesses twice the electrical power of Elec Man, his programming makes him somewhat scatterbrained. One might say he has a couple screws loose."
Splash Woman,"She is the first and only female Robot Master, but originally she was going to be a male Robot Master named Ocean Man, whose power would have presumably involved soaking up the thirst of the land. "
Spring Man,"His stage in Mega Man 7 underwent the most drastic change from its development period. In its original build, the stage was an abandoned toy factory that included doll cameos of Ryu and Chun-Li from Street Fighter II, Nina from Breath of Fire and Pure from Adventure Quiz: Capcom World 2. One particularly notable area was Spring Man's boss room which had a giant furnace full of toys being incinerated."
Star Man,The stage select portraits of Star Man and Proto Man in Mega Man 5 are modified versions of each other. The redesign of Star Man’s portrait in 8BDM has garnered some mixed reception.
Stone Man,"He is possibly based on a golem, an animated anthropomorphic being in Jewish folklore that is created entirely from inanimate matter (usually clay or mud). If that is the case, if one were to remove the green gem on Stone Man’s chest, then they might just find a “shem” or the name of God."
Sword Man,"Because of his large blade and Aussie accent, this guy makes me think of that scene in Crocodile Dundee, where Mick Dundee and his gf run into a mugger with a switchblade, and Mick laughs and says, “That’s not a knife.” Then he pulls out a much bigger knife and says, “That’s a knife.”"
Tengu Man,"He has different stage themes in the Saturn and PlayStation versions of Mega Man 8. With his theme from Mega Man & Bass, he's the only classic series Robot Master to have three official stage themes. What a legend."
Time Man,His design is meant to resemble that of a traditional bell-style alarm clock. Clocks are generally used to tell the time.
Toad Man,"We all know he is the easiest boss in Mega Man 4 (if the player shoots him after every hop, he will never attack). That being said, in the Game Gear version, Toad Man hops considerably faster, making avoiding his jumps and attacking him more difficult (he’s probably still easy)."
Tomahawk Man,"He and his stage are believed to represent the United States, as his design appears to incorporate elements of both indigenous North American peoples and Cowboys, while his stage seems to be set in the American Old West. The term “tomahawk,” which refers to a type of single-handed axe, came into the English language in the 17th century as an adaptation of the Powhatan word “tamahaac.”"
Top Man,"The quote from his Mega Man & Bass CD Data is a tediously predictable reference to the 80's hit song ""You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"" by Dead or Alive. Honestly, he didn’t even try."
Tornado Man,"He was originally Weather Man and his design was based around a weather satellite. If you look at all the concept art, you can see how he started off bearing zero resemblance to Gyro Man whatsoever and evolved into the unfortunate final product you see today. "
Turbo Man,"His weakness to the Noise Crush is likely a reference to the constant issue of mufflers and its effect on automobile engines. Mufflers themselves must be of the right type for the engine they are designed to reduce the noise for said engine's activity. However, a common issue is how mufflers themselves inadvertently reduce engine efficiency by obstructing the exhaust flow and that a damaged one worsens its already existing back pressure."
Uranus,
Venus,
Wave Man,His being weak to the Charge Kick in Mega Man 5 is in reference to how beach waves themselves are able to be overcome with direct head-on force of greater mass and energy behind it. At least in 8BDM he’s able to hang from the ceiling while others have to routinely get Charge Man’s foot rammed up their asses.
Wind Man,"He is believed to represent China. The queue on his head and the meander pattern on his head and belt sort of make this one cut and dry, right?"
Wood Man,"There is a MIDI arrangement of his stage theme known as “mm2wood” and it is notorious for its off-sync instruments, overly loud percussion, and other inaccuracies. It is the basis of a video made on MIDIJam, and watching this video renders just about everything else in life slightly disappointing."
Yamato Man,"The word Yamato means ""great sum,"" ""great harmony,"" or ""great peace"" and is the name used for ancient Japan and the peoples of Japan as a whole. The Yamato is also one of the oldest hereditary monarchies still in existence. It is also the ancient name corresponding to the modern-day Nara prefecture. Yamato Man's head is based off the kabuto-style samurai helmets that often sport ornate crests, which were unique signatures to distinguish certain individuals/families/clans from each other. I can go all day with this guy’s trivia."
