CLEANUP TODO LIST


General
    - Refactor any code that is seen in multiple methods
        - Checking if channel has permission for botcommands
        - Check if embed limit is reached
        - loading and saving json files
    - For the code that interacts with json files, make it so it does not need a path to be manually inserted. 

All Commands
    - Make sure every command checks if it has permission to post in the designated channel.
    - There is a situation where, if a command requires an argument and no argument is given, there will be no return from the bot to say the input was incorrect. 


SmashBros Commands
    - Fix !smashprofiles command so that it shows smash character icons instead of just their name.
    - Create multiple embeds in the situation that the embed limit is reached. 

Fun Commands
    - Clean up/complete the race/betting commands.
    
Help command
    - Fix format to be more like the !smashhelp command

Audio Commands
    - Recreate everything in my own code.
